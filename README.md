# 301CREngine
301CREngine - PrettyEngine

Notes:
    - The solution might have different setting. Please run the GenerateProject.bat file before openning the solution.
    - There is a problem within FMOD. It doesn't like when using the keyboard to change the volume. Please, do not change the volume from the keyboard!
    - The executable in the BinariesForAssignment might not work on your machine (idk why it works on mine). There is a second executable in the PrettyEngine folder
